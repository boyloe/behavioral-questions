# 30 Behavioral Questions
### Teamwork

1. **Talk about a time when you had to work closely with someone whose personality was very different from yours.**

    A. Working on a rig in North Dakota, I was paired with a women who was about 10 years older than me. She was a very abrupt, brash, and outspoken person. I was less than a year into the oilfield and was a little more reserved. She was very set in the way that she wanted things run and would strongly react if I tried to implement my style of doing things. This went on for a few rotations where I would set up something in way that I felt was more efficient but when I came back after my off rotation, everything would be back to the old method (her way). After 2-3 episodes of this, I asked her to schedule an extra hour during our changeout so we could discuss 'best practices' This went great. I was able to explain to her my methods and how I felt that they could improve our efficiency and customer relations (delivering reports on a set schedule, providing greater detail, etc.) and she was able to tell me how her methods had served her well over her career (she had much more experience) but could see the merits in implementing some of my stuff. We were able to compromise and had opened a better avenue for dialogue between us. 

2. **Give me an example of a time you faced a conflict while working on a team. How did you handle that?**

3. **Describe a time when you struggled to build a relationship with someone important. How did you eventually overcome that?**

4. **We all make mistakes we wish we could take back. Tell me about a time you wish you'd handled a situation differently with a colleague.**
